Hide Folders XP, version 2.9.8
------------------------------
Most everyone has files or folders 
on their computer that they 
do not want to share with others. 
This might include financial information, 
tax information, passwords, personal 
letters and memos and other private data.
The best way to protect your personal 
information is to make the folders in
which they reside visible and available 
ONLY to you.
Hide Folders XP does exactly that, 
and it does it easily and well.
